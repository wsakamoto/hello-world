Hello World,

Wes here, I'm new to all this but not to coding.  I majored in machine language coding in college and worked the firmware for Verifone
out of college.  I worked in the finanical industry as a financial advisor for a long time but now I'm going to see if I still have
some of my software coding skills.

Wes
